hw 09 - Yaaasss Queens
2018 - 02- 27

You know each is solvable as long as n in the nXn board is greater than 3.
That  is because if you start out putting one queen, it takes over most
of the spaces, not giving it enough spaces to put down more queens.
You can check how many solutions there are by starting out with n solutions
and then finding which ones are just reflections of each other. If they are
reflections. then you count them as one solution instead of 2.
